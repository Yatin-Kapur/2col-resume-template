# 2col-resume-template
 
Template created in LaTeX for a two column resume. Has a 65-30 (5 for margins) split using minipages. All new commands to create sections have been commented and included in the preamble, the right hand section still needs a bit of formatting but most of it is easily usable through tables and including vertical spaces.
