# 2col-resume-template
 
Template created in LaTeX for a two column resume. Has a 65-30 (5 for margins) split using minipages. All new commands to create sections have been commented and included in the preamble, the right hand section still needs a bit of formatting but most of it is easily usable through tables and including vertical spaces.

Only current problem is that there is overflow of text on the right hand column, so there may be need of trial and error.
